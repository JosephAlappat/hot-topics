        <h1>The Value of Money</h1>
        <p>Money has become one of the most important aspects of human development. It has been integrated into the
            human living so much so that it is impossible to think of an economy without money. But this has evolved
            over time in many ways. Starting with the barter system where trading commodity was the name of the game,
            things were straightforward and interactions were small, this was specifically suitable for smaller
            communities with limited numbers of people. Over time, as communities, people and interactions grew, it
            logically did not make sense to continue with the barter system. As kingdoms and political systems
            developed, a more transferable commodity was needed to take the place. As time went on, people experimented
            with metals, stones, gold, silver, papyrus, and other tradable commodities. As the world grew, as trade
            expanded to national, international and intercontinental levels, economies started to develop, different
            forms of currencies started to come into the picture. This is where we find ourselves; a world united by
            different currencies all dancing a fine line of balance. We also happen to find ourselves amid a tectonic
            shift as well. Over the past few years, we find a shift in usage of money from physical form to the digital
            form. Much of what used to be physical money (notes and coins) has now taken the form of Cards, tap-to-pay,
            mobile wallets, stocks, bitcoin. Much of the money has evolved to assets and liabilities leading to
            complicated assessments and financial image of an individual. In my opinion, this is a positive development
            with its pros and cons. While we get to breath easy knowing that pickpockets and thieves and cannot snatch
            our money, and even if they did, all the money can be safely secured in a phone call, on the flip side, we
            are now facing an ever looming threat of cyber-security where multiple negative entities are trying their
            best to snatch that buried money in layers and layers of encryption; an ongoing game of cat and mouse.
            However, the value of the money itself has now become synonym with the well-being of the world itself. It is
            like a bet, where the world decided to bet everything on one thing: money. While holding the world up with
            its complexities, helping it move forward, it also is snap away from throwing it all down. The idea of
            inflation, presents a case for the world to take caution and proceed at a slower careful pace.</p>

        <h1>GMO Food</h1>
        <p>GMO food or genetically modified foods have taken the world by storm. While there are both sides to this new
            trend, it is important that matters like these be taken and dealt with seriously. GMO foods entail the
            genetic modification of any naturally occurring food item to boost or suppress certain characteristics that
            are genetic. In a way, it can be said that we are working with and against evolution; sometimes advancing
            what would be a natural development, at times working against the natural order of things. However, GMO
            foods in a human aspect is much more interesting. Humans have been eating natural food for as long as they
            existed. These have benefited us and have helped us grow. With GMO, we are modifying the natural order to
            suit our needs. While this may seem like a great thing at present, it is very difficult to gauge its impact
            on humans and nature in the long run, over decades and centuries. GMO is still in its infancy and the
            influence, positive or negative, is inevitable. While all may be well and things will be better in future as
            humans always adapt forward, it is always better to exercise caution and restraint in how we proceed ahead
            with this. This also opens up the possibility of engineering foods as weapons. If people were to use GMO
            foods as means to inject chemicals, mass produce a food without/with certain harmful traits, infecting the
            crops at large, the possibilities are endless, and the worst part, it will be hidden from plain sight. And
            therefore, as with anything, we must have strict policies and guidelines concerning these, an international
            government body acting as a regulator and watchmen of its ethical use.</p>

        <h1>The View of the world in 2100</h1>
        <p>The world has evolved over its many years of existence. From developing biomes to shifting terrains, from new
            species to extinct ones, the world has had many waves of changes leading to where we are now. However, it is
            difficult to predict where the world will go in 2100. This is mainly because of the intensely disruptive
            nature of humanity. Humans, with their vast intellect and ideas have changed the course of the world more
            than ones. A 100 years ago, AI would have been unimaginable. The power and potential that AI holds is
            massive and will drastically change how the future will unfold. With AI acting as a catalyst, the
            possibility of future is multiple. It is fair to assume that there will be highly advanced space
            explorations, a new age of electrical vehicles and a world built around sustainability. It is also possible
            that there will be new modes of currency, highly advanced and specially designed medical equipment, and
            probably, highly deadly and destructive weapons. If we look at the world and its development over the last
            few centuries, we see that every development has brought with it new innovations and, unfortunately, new
            weapons based on those innovative ideas. The world always developed both sides equally, its constructive and
            destructive prowess always were at par with each other. This begs the question, with development, will the
            world be a better place with a knife hanging on top of it? Or will a new era usher without any destructive
            elements, or would there be a new kind of evil, one that bends even the most imaginative of minds!</p>
